### How I Build

```typescript
// My development philosophy
const buildProduct = (idea) => {
  const agents = assembleTeam('jp-rocks');
  const plan = agents.waterfall(idea);
  const product = agents.execute(plan);
  const verified = agents.playwrightTest(product);
  return verified ? ship(product) : iterate(product);
};

// Ship fast. Test everything. Let agents handle the rest.
```
